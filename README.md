Description:

    Glas is a Pythonic Offshot language that got out of hand, with which 
     you can speak like this: 
     
        why: cookie jar ~ empty: -> cookie monster  ~ why: "?"
        > cookie_monster.why(cookie_jar.empty()).why("?")

    Umm, yeah. 

    This project has NOTHING to do with any consumer devices conneted with the 
     English word for window furniture applicant (or something like that).

    It comes from the Bulgarian word for Voice (Глас) or a characterization 
     of a loud-mouth speaker (Гласовит).
     
    It has nothing to do with the English language besides the near pronunciation
     of Стъкло.

    If big corps. come at my ass, I would immediatly change it's name to
     something like Styks (which means Стъкло script in Bulgarian)
     
    So if you are a big corp. then just contact me, we would figure($)
     something out about it ;)
