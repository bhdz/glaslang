glaslang: The Glas Programming Language
========

Hi.

Glas is a Pythonic Offshot language that got out of hand.

        don't advertise Glas (that's my job ;))

Motto:
 
    "SYNTAX_ERROR? Mission Impossible!"


Description:

    Glas is a Pythonic Offshot language that got out of hand, with which 
     you can speak like this: 
     
        why: cookie jar ~ empty: -> cookie monster  ~ why: "?"
        #> cookie_monster.why(cookie_jar.empty()).why("?")
        
    In fact, Glas is hardly a computer language at all. It's more like 
     training wheels for the machine to understand common English language.
     
    I would be surprised if Glas doesn't become one of the most popular
     languages for teaching. Teach the kid to form sentences in pure 
     English and then simply help him/her with Glasification of the sentence.
    
    Like this:
     "Petar went for a banana, a pear, a big orange, and carried them in a 
      basket home"
    
    Petar went for a banana, a pear, a big orange, 
        and carried them in a basket home
     > ERROR! weak! 
     > F--!
     
    Petar ~ went: for a banana, a pear, a big orange, 
        and carried them in a basket home
     > Petar.went(for_a_banana, a_pear, a_big_orange, and_carried_...
     > ERROR! getting better ... 
     > E+ ...
    
    Petar ~ went: for a banana, a pear, a big orange, 
        and: carried them in a basket home
     > Petar.went(for_a_banana, a_pear, a_big_orange, and(carried_...
     > ERROR! Almost there, don't give up ;) 
     > C-!

     > ERROR! Almost there, you can sense yourself gloating with an 'A' infront 
     >  of your parents. 
     > B-
    
    Petar ~ went: for a banana, a pear, a big orange ~
        and: carried them in a basket home
     > Warning! You did it... just finish it for a perfect score. 
     > A--
    
    Petar ~ went: for a banana, a pear, a big orange ~
        and: ~ carried them: in a basket home
     > BINGO! You've got your A! 
     >  Now go ask your parents for more allowance, or score a FATAL
    
    Petar ~ went: for a banana, a pear, a big orange ~
        and: ~ carried: them, in a basket, home
     > FATALITY! A+! You're a star, and you ROCK!
