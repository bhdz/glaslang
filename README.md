Hi.

Glas is a Pythonic Offshot language that got out of hand.

        not advertise Glas (that's my job ;))

Motto:
 
    "SYNTAX_ERROR? Mission Impossible!"


Description:

    Glas is a Pythonic Offshot language that got out of hand, with which 
     you can speak like this: 
     
        why: cookie jar ~ empty: -> cookie monster  ~ why: "?"
        > cookie_monster.why(cookie_jar.empty()).why("?")
        
    In fact, Glas is hardly a computer language at all! It's more like 
     training wheels for the machine to understand common English language.
     
    I would be totaly surprised if Glas *doesn't* become THE most popular
     language for teaching. Yeah. Teach the kid to form sentences in pure 
     English and then juuust help him/her with Glasification of the sentence!
    
    Like this:
     "Petar went for a banana, a pear, a big orange, and carried them in a 
      basket home"
      
    Check this learning process out ;)
    
    Petar went for a banana, a pear, a big orange, 
        and carried them in a basket home
    > ERROR! weak! 
    > F--!
     
    Petar ~ went: for a banana, a pear, a big orange, 
        and carried them in a basket home

        and: ~ carried: them, in a basket, home

I hope you like it.

    Umm, yeah. 

    This project has NOTHING to do with any consumer devices conneted with the 
     English word for window furniture applicant (or something like that).

    It comes from the Bulgarian word for Voice (Глас) or a characterization 
     of a loud-mouth speaker (Гласовит).
     
    It has nothing to do with the English language besides the near pronunciation
     of Стъкло.

    If big corps. come at my ass, I would immediatly change it's name to
     something like Styks (which means Стъкло script in Bulgarian)
     
    So if you are a big corp. then just contact me, we would figure($)
     something out about it ;)
     
Enjoy!
