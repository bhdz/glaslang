    Glas is a Pythonic Offshot language that got out of hand, you can speak like this: 
    why: cookie jar ~ empty: -> cookie monster  ~ why: "?"

    # $ cookie_monster.why(cookie_jar.empty()).why("?")

    
Moto: 
    "Syntax Error? Mission Impossible!"

I hope you like it.

Umm, yeah. 

This project has NOTHING to do with any consumer devices conneted with the 
 English word for window furniture applicant (or something like that).

It comes from the Bulgarian word for Voice (Глас) or a characterization 
 of a loud-mouth speaker (Гласовит).
 
It has nothing to do with the English language besides the near pronunciation
 of Стъкло.

If big corps. come at my ass, I would immediatly change it's name to
 something like Styks (which means Стъкло script in Bulgarian)
 
So if you are a big corp. then just contact me, we would figure($)
 something out about it ;)
