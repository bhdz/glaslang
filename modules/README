Hi.

This directory contains all the needed Python modules in order for the 
 Glas system to run. PYTHON modules, not glas. I leave GlasGlas (or glagla)
 as an excersize for the reader ;)

Nothing to see here, folks! 

The whole Glas concept is still very young (less than a week old: 2013-06-06)

The interpreter is highly volatile, the syntax is still being developed, and
 still, the author is in concept()ing mode. 

Be patient! ... or make your own damn interpreter :D 

I am planning to be finished with the translator by the last week of June.

After all, first of July is comming and I've gotta celebrate Jully morning w/
 some friends, 'cid, and beers. Laterz!

Enjoy!
