# Notes:

# {name'sub@language} doesn't distingish between tuples and lists
# For him, tuples are just a modification on lists which uses block memory, vs. linked list nodes. Check out the special file

# Gollum doesn't distinguish between methods/functions and regular objects.
# If tis' method it evaluate it's return, and if it's object's properties, this.

# It uses `char` to define a character
# It uses ' and . for property access

# This is a kind of EBNF FILE
