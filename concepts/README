Hi.

This directory describes the different concepts of Glas described in 
 *.concept files which might be an utf-8 plain text file or something else.

Eyeball them out or use glas.concept utility to manipulate, read, write, so on
 *.concept files. 
 
If any computer is supposed to interpret them, then probably that language
 will be Glas itself. Glas is general enough for that task.


Usually concepts are fully freeform, but it's nice to start your concept with
 "Hi." and end it with "Enjoy!"
 
Glas.Concept helper will understand "Hi."s and "Enjoy!"s and aid you in 
 developing your concept further.

Enjoy!
