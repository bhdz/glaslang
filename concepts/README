This directory describes the different concepts of Glas described in 
 *.concept files which might be an utf-8 plain text file or something else.

Eyeball them out or use glas.concept utility to manipulate, read, write, so on
 *.concept files. 
 
If any computer is supposed to interpret them, then probably that language
 will be Glas itself. Glas is general enough for that task.
