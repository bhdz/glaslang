#!/usr/bin/env glas.concept

Hi.

This is the concept file for the Concept concept { the last one to close 
 the doors }

Think of this concept as a weapon for surval. 

Let that be off, your otherwise Free, Creative, and Joyous, mind.

Motto:
    "This is the concept Concept concept. So Meta!"
    
This file is a metaglas file so glas here will try glas.shepot on it
 and "teach" itself how to read more and more of the file itself using the 
 text itself as a guideline how to load more and more interpreters.
 It might fail totally, in which case, it goes "There's no WORDS ONIT FCKIT 
 I'm going LIVE" on your /dev/stdout. Poor you, feed your glascupz better.
 
+glascup: A glascup is a glas.concept process instance which reads, 
 gathers interpreter info, interprets, and integrates,  outputs results 
 somewhere. You are filling the glascup

So right here let me show you what I am blabbing about. Now I will hint the 
 current glascup (my wretched brain) to load an interpreter for Glas itself.
 I will try twice, one soft, one hard. It would either NOW_FGLIVE it or 
 { NOW_FGLIVE it means "No words (on it), fuck it, i'm going live" condition }
 
Also I will define the semantic structure of the Concept concept concept.

Firstly, it needs A Dictionary, and An Elaboration on that Dictionary.
By now, a smart glascup, knows this text is interpretable by Glas so it's 
interpreted already with PRECON(DITION) interpretation, just waiting for my 
 signal to start executing "REAL" (my own commands). The PRECON interetation
 up until clear signal should be there after the whole run of the glascup.
 
After that on my command, the Glas "REALCON" would turned off, a conclusion
 is to be drawn by machine and man, and finaly, integrated with MANCON (man made 
 conditional interpretation of results).
 
The results should be outputed elsewhere, worst on /dev/stdout, even worse on 
 /dev/net/eth0
 
More and more elaborations are added into the concept, all on the same 
 dictionary. Elaborations are a way to enrich the information linked inside the
 dictionary, adding opinions, and other general blablabla
 
So let's try interpreting this filly softly:

{! glas !}
{{ "Test" * 3 }} # Did it work?

Obviously not, but hey, why not again, this time with more force:
    None, Hash, Exclamation, Something Else
 
#!/usr/bin/env glas.shepot

# O-K, now we should be inside the Glas glascup condition (REALCON)

# Let's define a single Dictionary word, don't worry about class/object 
#  dichotomy you deal with words here.
 
Dictionary:
    Brassiere, Brazier, Brain, Mind^Map, Brainzy, Brainy, Sex, Fucking, 
    Conception, Inception { fuck this movie }, ... { fill in the blanks }
    
    glogo ~ [ LOL LOL LOL, glogo is Glas Logos, the elaboration "manager".
        Call him mr. glogo ]
        
#
# Let's default: this Elaboration to be the main one, the root if you will
#
# For now we've linked Dictionary ~ Elaboration property
#  And for now each glascup will have this association
#

Elaboration -> Dictionary:

    Brassieres | Brass^ier | Sex: Brassiere, Brazier, Brain
        -> [
                Well you know... the act of it. What the hell are you doing
                when surViving. 
            ]
    
    Sexy | Mindful | Intelligent | Beautiful: Brainy, Brainzy, Combo+bruity 
        -> [ 
                Positive Combination of Brainzy/Brainy for each match, 
                Comes from (Comb)inat(O)rial (Br)ain Cong(ruity) \:D.
                Each couple of people has a certain Combobruity lvlz that
                match more or less. O(n) of your wretched relationship :D
                
                Don't share your combobruity publically you stupid! ;)
                select people with whom you might want to perform a match
                try() :D
                
                Otherwise you would be laughed at and ridiculed and your 
                brainzy/brainy meters will fall like a penis infront of a 
                ... hmm... you fill those lines.
            ]
            
    Kinks | Sex Toys | Tools | Utilities: Brain, Mind^Map
        -> [
                Well, all survival needs some kind of teeth, claws, 
                brainz/boobs/penises ratio, tools, weapons, spears, and 
                software. etc. etc. whatever noun you might think of relating
                the survival game. Therefore, Kinks is an appropriate term.
           ]

> glas: stop ->> shepot

OK. now we instructed Glas interpreter to STOP right here, and do a 
 integration pass (the whole document up until the language marker,
 the interpreted text between the stop and the marker, and finaly
 this text until the end or another language marker as a conclusion.
 
Let's try something else. just for kicks, shits and giggles

#!/usr/bin/env python

from glasl import Glas

Glas().Dictionary( {
        'glogo' :  { 
            'binary': '/usr/bin/env glas.concept',
            'concept': 'glogo.concept'
         },
    }
)

Glas().Dictionary(
 {
 }
)
Enjoy!
